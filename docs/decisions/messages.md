- **What it is:** an iMessage client and a front end to Messages.app. Messages.app stays signed in and does the actual sending and receiving.
  - No unified inbox for now.
  - No messaging service of our own.
- **Reading:** query `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` directly, read-only. This requires Full Disk Access.
- **Our own data:** a SQLiteData database only for app-specific state like pins, drafts and settings. A search index can come later.
- **Detecting changes:** watch `chat.db` and its WAL file for writes, then re-run the active queries.
- **Sending:** script Messages.app with AppleScript, which requires the Automation permission.
  - Text and files are supported.
  - Tapbacks, replies and edits aren't supported in v1, because they'd need private frameworks and disabling SIP.
- **Notifications:** left to Messages.app in v1.
- **Contact names:** resolved through the Contacts framework, which requires the Contacts permission.
- **Onboarding:** a first-launch flow that walks through granting Full Disk Access, Automation and Contacts.

## Notes

- `chat.db` is in WAL mode, so we can read it live while Messages.app writes to it.
- Some message text lives only in `attributedBody`, an `NSAttributedString` archived in the legacy typedstream format, not in `text`. `AttributedBody.text(from:)` reads just the string payload in pure Swift, instead of using the deprecated, non-secure `NSUnarchiver`. It matched `NSUnarchiver` on all ~70k blobs in a real `chat.db` and runs about 20× faster.
- `attributedBody` is the more complete source of text. `text` sometimes omits leading content (e.g. mentions), and differs by U+FFFC attachment placeholders.
